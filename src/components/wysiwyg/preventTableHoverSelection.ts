/**
 * Robust table pointer interaction. Solves two related bugs that only
 * surfaced in Tauri's WebKit engine:
 *
 * 1. "cell이 드래그하지 않아도 자동으로 드래그되는" — on mousedown
 *    prosemirror-tables attaches its OWN mousemove/mouseup listeners to
 *    `view.root` (the document) and extends a CellSelection on every mousemove
 *    while `tableEditingKey` state is active. If the terminating mouseup is
 *    missed (pointer leaves the window, drag ends outside the editor, focus
 *    loss — frequent in Tauri's WebKit) that state goes stale and every later
 *    HOVER grows the selection. Swallowing the mousemove via handleDOMEvents
 *    cannot help: that document-level listener fires regardless. Instead we
 *    track the real primary-button state (pointerdown/up/cancel + window blur)
 *    and, when a mousemove arrives with the button up but a drag still active,
 *    trigger prosemirror-tables' own teardown by dispatching a mouseup to
 *    `view.root` — removing its move listener and clearing the stale state.
 *
 * 2. A click that incidentally produces a single-cell CellSelection (which
 *    paints the whole cell as "selected" and makes the column/row-add buttons
 *    operate on the wrong target) is collapsed back to a plain text caret on
 *    pointerup — but only for clicks (small movement), so deliberate drag
 *    selections survive. This runs on pointerup, never during typing, so it
 *    can't interfere with CJK composition the way a per-transaction
 *    normaliser did.
