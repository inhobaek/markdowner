Markdowner is a local-first Markdown editor for macOS, built for people who want a polished writing surface without giving up plain `.md` files. It combines WYSIWYG editing, source editing, workspace navigation, and a Rust document core that keeps Markdown as the source of truth.

The app is also designed to work well as the editor that coding agents and command-line tools can open when they need a human to edit a buffer, review a note, or finish a commit message.

## Highlights

- **Markdown-native editing**: WYSIWYG, source editor, and split view all work against Markdown files rather than a proprietary document format.
- **Local desktop shell**: open files or folders, manage tabs, save safely, restore sessions, and handle files through the native macOS app.
- **Workspace navigation**: file tree, Quick Open, command palette, outline panel, workspace search, document stats, and recent documents.
- **Writing ergonomics**: find and replace, minimap, word wrap controls, wrap guide, focus mode, typewriter mode, table editing, code blocks, checklists, and image/link support.
- **Safer file writes**: atomic saves, dirty-close confirmation, read-only file handling, and external-change detection with reload/keep-local flows.
- **Customizable reading and editing**: built-in light/dark themes, system-theme following, imported CSS themes, editor font controls, table density, and code-block theme settings.
- **Agent-friendly CLI integration**: install the `mdner` command and set `EDITOR` / `VISUAL` so terminal tools can open Markdowner directly.
- **Release-aware app**: update checks read GitHub Releases, and the public release workflow builds a universal macOS DMG.

## Install

Markdowner currently ships for macOS.

Download the latest DMG from:

```text
https://github.com/channprj/markdowner/releases/latest
```

Or install the latest release from the terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/channprj/markdowner/main/install.sh | bash
```

To install and launch immediately:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/channprj/markdowner/main/install.sh | MARKDOWNER_OPEN=1 bash
```

The installer downloads the latest matching `.dmg` asset, mounts it, copies `Markdowner.app` into `/Applications`, and clears the local quarantine attribute for the installed bundle.

> Markdowner uses ad-hoc signing for no-cost distribution today. Developer ID signing and notarization are planned, so macOS may still require manual approval from System Settings on first launch after a downloaded install.

## Quick Start

1. Launch Markdowner.
2. Open a Markdown file with `Cmd+O`, or open a folder with `Cmd+Shift+O`.
3. Switch modes with `Opt+1` for WYSIWYG, `Opt+2` for Editor, and `Opt+3` for Split View.
4. Use `Cmd+P` for Quick Open and `Cmd+Shift+P` for the command palette.
5. Save with `Cmd+S`.

Useful shortcuts:

| Action | Shortcut |
| --- | --- |
| Quick Open | `Cmd+P` |
| Command Palette | `Cmd+Shift+P` |
| Find in Current File | `Cmd+F` |
| Search in Workspace | `Cmd+Shift+F` |
| Toggle Sidebar | `Cmd+Shift+B` |
| Toggle Outline | `Cmd+Shift+D` |
| Toggle Focus Mode | `Cmd+Shift+J` |
| Toggle Typewriter Mode | `Cmd+Shift+Y` |
| Toggle Word Wrap | `Option+Z` |

## CLI Integration

Markdowner can install a small `mdner` launcher so command-line tools can open files or folders in the desktop app:

```bash
mdner README.md
mdner path/to/project
```

From the app, open **Settings** and use the CLI sections to:

- install or remove `/usr/local/bin/mdner`
- add a managed shell snippet for `EDITOR="mdner"` and `VISUAL="mdner"`
- verify whether the command is available on your shell `PATH`

This is useful with tools that spawn `$EDITOR` for commit messages, prompts, notes, or review buffers.

## Development

Markdowner is built with Tauri v2, React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tiptap, CodeMirror 6, Tailwind CSS, and a Rust workspace.

Recommended local toolchain:

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+
- Rust stable
- Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the desktop app in development mode:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

The Vite dev server is pinned to `http://127.0.0.1:14238` with `strictPort` enabled so it does not silently attach to another local app.

## Build

Common commands:

```bash
pnpm build                         # type-check and build the frontend
pnpm build debug                   # debug Tauri build
pnpm build dmg                     # release DMG with ad-hoc signing
pnpm build universal dmg           # Apple Silicon + Intel universal DMG
pnpm build install                 # build and install to /Applications
pnpm build install open            # install, then launch the installed app
pnpm build:install:open            # package-script alias for install + open
pnpm build:mac:dmg                 # package-script alias for release DMG
pnpm build:mac:universal:dmg       # package-script alias for universal DMG
```

Install path overrides:

```bash
MARKDOWNER_INSTALL_PATH=~/Applications pnpm build install
pnpm build install -- --path ~/Applications
pnpm build install -- --no-build
pnpm build install -- --open
```

## Test

Run the main verification suite:

```bash
pnpm test
cargo test
```

Useful focused checks:

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run
bash scripts/build-and-install.test.sh
cargo test -p markdowner-core
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
```

## Release

Markdowner uses the repo-root `VERSION` file and date-based versions in the form:

```text
MAJOR.YYMMDD.PATCH
```

Refresh the date/patch version locally:

```bash
pnpm bump refresh
```

Push a release bump from `main`:

```bash
pnpm bump refresh --push
```

That command syncs `VERSION` into `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `Cargo.lock`, commits those version files, and pushes to `main`.

The GitHub Actions release workflow then:

1. reads `VERSION`
2. installs the Node and Rust toolchains
3. syncs version metadata
4. builds a universal macOS DMG
5. creates the GitHub Release with `gh release create --generate-notes`
6. uploads the generated DMG asset

GitHub generates the release notes by comparing the new release with the previous tag.

## Repository Layout

```

## Current Status

Markdowner is usable today as a macOS desktop Markdown editor, with the core writing, navigation, settings, local build, and release paths in place.

Still planned:

- Developer ID signing and notarization
- Windows build, test, and release validation
- HTML/PDF/print export
- richer image asset workflows
- automated desktop E2E, screenshot regression, and accessibility gates
